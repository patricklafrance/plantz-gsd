# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-16)

**Core value:** Users can see at a glance which plants need watering today and log it in one action — extended to multi-user households with rotating responsibility
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — schema-foundation-data-migration

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-04-17

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- URL-scoped routing: `/h/[householdSlug]/...` for all authenticated routes — implemented in Phase 1, propagated through Phase 6 (Pitfall 17 prevention)
- Cron: pure external cron via cron-job.org hitting `/api/cron/advance-cycles` — no Vercel Cron, no lazy/request-time transitions
- Invitation tokens: CSPRNG (`crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`), no expiry, owner-revocable, store SHA-256 hash
- `@date-fns/tz` (TZDate) mandatory for DST-safe cycle arithmetic — `date-fns-tz` (marnusw) is incompatible with date-fns v4
- `HouseholdNotification` is a separate model from `Reminder` — cycle events must not merge with per-plant daily reminders
- Three-step migration ritual is a hard gate: nullable add → backfill SQL → NOT NULL; single-step forbidden

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is highest-recovery-cost phase in the milestone: migration order, cascade behavior, and `householdId` index design must all be correct before any feature work ships
- v1 tech debt to fix in Phase 5: `NotificationBell` hidden on mobile; `BottomTabBar` Alerts links to `/dashboard` instead of notifications
